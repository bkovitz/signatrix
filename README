Signatrix
---------
Signatrix is a program that scans Latin verse and infers vowel
quantities and accents.


How to run Signatrix
--------------------
Before you can do anything, you'll need Python (version 3) installed on
your system.

Signatrix has three commands: read, dump, and tally.

   python3 signatrix.py read filename

      Reads 'filename' (a text file of Latin verse), scans them,
      and stores the scans to 'filename.db', a database that you'll
      need for the other commands.

      It can take a couple hours to scan a file of 1000 lines. This is
      why Signatrix stores the scans in a database: so you can do things
      with the scans without regenerating them.


   python3 signatrix.py dump dbname.db

      Outputs the scans stored in the specified database.


   python3 signatrix.py tally dbname1.db dbname2.db ...

      Tallies all the words and word forms that appear in the specified
      databases, and outputs results in this format:


Modifying Signatrix
-------------------
If you'd like to modify Signatrix or experiment with different ways to
scan, look at the Makefile. It contains a target, 'ut', that runs a
suit of unit tests be sure you haven't broken anything. To run the unit
tests, type this at the shell prompt:

   make ut

Signatrix
---------
Signatrix is a program that scans Latin verse and infers vowel
quantities and accents.


How to run Signatrix
--------------------
Before you can do anything, you'll need Python (version 3) installed on
your system.

Signatrix has three commands: read, dump, and tally.

   python3 signatrix.py read filename

      Reads 'filename' (a text file of Latin verse), scans them,
      and stores the scans to 'db/filename.db', a database that you'll
      need for the other commands.

      It can take a couple hours to scan a file of 1000 lines. This is
      why Signatrix stores the scans in a database: so you can do things
      with the scans without regenerating them.


   python3 signatrix.py dump dbname.db

      Outputs the scans stored in the specified database. All databases
      must be in the ./db subdirectory.


   python3 signatrix.py tally dbname1.db dbname2.db ...

      Tallies all the words and word forms that appear in the specified
      databases, and outputs results in this format:

        trojae (occurrences: 1, scans: 7)
          trōjāĕ 0.1429
          trŏjāĕ 0.1429
          trŏĭæ 0.1429
          trŏĭāĕ 0.1429
          trŏjăē 0.1429
          trŏjæ 0.1429
          trōjæ 0.1429
        virumque (occurrences: 1, scans: 7)
          vĭrumquē 0.2857
          vĭrumquĕ 0.7143
    
      All databases must be in the ./db subdirectory.


Modifying Signatrix
-------------------
If you'd like to modify Signatrix or experiment with different ways to
scan, look at the Makefile. It contains a target, 'ut', that runs a
suit of unit tests be sure you haven't broken anything. To run the unit
tests, type this at the shell prompt:

   make ut
